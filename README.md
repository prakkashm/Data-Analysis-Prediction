# Data-Analysis-Prediction
- This project involves analysis of a data set (details of which can't be disclosed). 
- After the analysis, a model needs to be fitted to the data to predict the dependent variable.
- Regression (Simple, Multiple and with/without outliers) and decision tree models are implemented & compared based on the diagnostic measures.
- Finally, the results are validated using the validation dataset.

#### Refer to the file "Task1_Reworked.Rmd" for the R Markdown code used for the analysis.
